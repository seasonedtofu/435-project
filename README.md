# 435-project

CLI created using python.
To run the 435CLI.py, you must have paramiko installed. (pip install paramiko)

The CLI is very crude and only has functions to return searches, CREATE, UPDATE, REMOVE functions not implemented to ensure database is not messed with.
To see ALL the CRUD functions/queries, look at queries.csv
